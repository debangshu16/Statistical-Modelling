This folder contains three R codes which contains my solution to the Assignment on MCMC given in CMI. All these codes focus on modelling using Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulations. 
1) The first R code correspond to modelling the waiting variable in the dataset "old faithful" dataset in R.
2) The second R code correspond to modelling the eruptions variable in the same dataset. 
3) The third R code correspond to modelling the air passengers time series data.
